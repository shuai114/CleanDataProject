##Coursera Course Project Cover Page

In the course project of the coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course offered by Johns Hopkins University, a dataset about wearable computing is required to be cleaned and transformed into a tidy dataset.

There are four items that are required to be submitted for this project:

* README.md: this document. It explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

* CodeBook.md: the code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data. It is included in this repo.

* run_analysis.R: my code for performing the analysis. It is included in this repo.

* A tidy data set: the tidy data set outputted by my code. It is submitted within my coursera account.

Here are what I performed in this analysis to clean up the data:

* Merges the subject identifier file, the activity file, and the feature file in the training and the test sets to create one data set.

* Extracts only the mean and standard deviation variables for each measurement. 

* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each extracted variable for each activity and each subject.
