##Coursera Course Project Cover Page

In the course project of the coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" course offered by Johns Hopkins University, a dataset about wearable computing is required to be cleaned and transformed into a tidy dataset.

There are four items that are required to be submitted for this project:

*README.md: this document. It explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

*CodeBook.md: the code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data. It is included in this repo.

*run_analysis.R: my code for performing the analysis. It is included in this repo.

*A tidy data set: the tidy data set outputted by my code. It is submitted within my coursera account.
